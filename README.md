# MRHOF-simplified
The work is based on some hard coding and modifications in the Objective Function of the RPL to observe the performance easily and make it comparable.
the Modified_RPL folder contents on execution gives a clearer and understandable output that clarifies the parent selection process. 
The testlog provided is a sample of a pre-performed simulation.(just for example)
The rest of the files outside the folder are helpful to measure the performance of the MRHOF on the basis of parent change count which may come handy as a comparision parameter while comparing with some other modified objective function.
The ana.pl file also takes a COOJA.testlog file as input and on the basis of control messages , it determines the packet delivery ratio which can also be considered as a comparision parameter.
